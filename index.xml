      <description>Objective Create a script that produces a postgresql database. The structure will be fixed and the contents of the db may vary. The shape of the data should be mostly the same so that every time I rebuild the db I can expect similar queries across rebuilds to output similar data.
End result This world is built and feed with fake-messaging-app-pg. I expect to keep changing it but I can call the first iteration completed.</description>

      <description>The Quest to learn GraphQL This is just a bunch of notes taken while learning about GraphQL.
What is graphql  http://graphql.org/ https://www.quora.com/What-problem-does-GraphQL-solve  There is graphql in different languages such as golang, nodejs and ruby among others.
 Ruby

      <description>Motivation I&amp;rsquo;m working on a project that uses guard-jasmine (1.19.2). For a number reasons I can&amp;rsquo;t upgrade it yet.
This morning the test headless test suite started failing with:

      <description>Motivation I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky to participate in many Coderetreats and I want to do a small coding practice that keeps the same feeling.
What is a Code retreat? The Coderetreat site says:
 Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design.
 A Code retreat day is structured in two main parts:
Setting context  A previously chosen exercise is explained to the audience, most of the times the chosen exercise is Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life.</description>

      <guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/resque-and-sidekiq/</guid>
      <description>Motivation Some months ago, at an interview I got asked this:
 What would you use resque or sidekiq and why?
 My answer was something along the lines of:
 Sidekiq consumes less memory, so that sounds better. Both Resque and Sidekiq are stable and widely used in production. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Resque in a 3 applications, two of them are still running and processing tons of background jobs. Before making my choice I would need to know the kind of background processing that we would do.</description>

      <title>RSpec and the Four Phase Tests</title>

      <description>Motivation I want to know what are the best practices to write RSpec tests when striving for a Four Phase Test.
What the internet says about it?  https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/four-phases-of-testing. https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-test-rails-applications http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/rspec-testing-for-beginners-part-1--cms-26716 http://www.justinweiss.com/articles/writing-better-tests-with-the-three-phase-pattern/  Notes so far  let may be is lazy and convenient. If another developer comes and looks at the it, he will see a mystery guest. You create a DSL within RSpec, DSL puzzle. Each piece of indirection improves high level view, but makes it more complex when you have to change it.</description>
