by using a pre-commit hook that runs RuboCop altogether. and with neomake so I can see errors/warnings right on my editor. Today I noticed that the reported errors/warnings in my editor and the command line are not the same. What happened here?
Is it neomake issue? I noticed that I had different versions of rubocop installed, because of reasons different projects have different versions of RuboCop.</description></item><item><title>TIL debugging Rails migrations</title><link>//chischaschos.github.io/post/til-rails-migrations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 15:06:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/til-rails-migrations/</guid><description>Notes If using references, the table you are referring to must already exists.

Who defines it? What contexts can services live in? Services best practices around naming and design. Eric Evan&amp;rsquo;s Domain driven design Service, when an operation does not conceptually belong to any object. Following the natural contours of the problem, you can implement these operations in services. See also Service (systems architecture).
Martin Fowler The Service Layer, defines an application&amp;rsquo;s boundary with a layer of services that establishes a set of available operations and coordinates the application&amp;rsquo;s response in each operation.</description></item><item><title>TIL debugging TLS</title><link>//chischaschos.github.io/post/debugging-tls/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2018 09:28:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/debugging-tls/</guid><description>Notes http://blog.fourthbit.com/2014/12/23/traffic-analysis-of-an-ssl-slash-tls-session https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/#host-ip https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-6.2.3 https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/20227/find-ssl-version-in-tcp-packets-in-established-tcp-connection</description></item><item><title>Argument Hash for a String#scan</title><link>//chischaschos.github.io/post/string-scan-with-hash/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 13:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/string-scan-with-hash/</guid><description>Check how this person used scan on a hash values https://exercism.io/tracks/ruby/exercises/scrabble-score/solutions/14220b7319e643d4990f38875830a2a5</description></item><item><title>TIL percentage encoding in ruby</title><link>//chischaschos.github.io/post/percent-enconding-in-ruby/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 13:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/percent-enconding-in-ruby/</guid><description>Motivation Document what options exist in Ruby whenever in I want to do Percent-Encoding.

This example uses the fake messaging app playgroung. What we are going to do is to get the messages from groups a user is part of, only the top 3 messages of each group sorted by creation date are returned.
This blog is written using commit cf971929380a91730dffb9b87177f664bd87aa1a of the fake messaging app playground.
An example use case What we are going to do is to obtain the latest 3 messages a user has from each group.</description></item><item><title>Lessons learned from creating a postgresql data playground</title><link>//chischaschos.github.io/post/lessons-learned-from-creating-a-postgresql-data-playground/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2017 23:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/lessons-learned-from-creating-a-postgresql-data-playground/</guid><description>Objective Create a script that produces a postgresql database. The structure will be fixed and the contents of the db may vary. The shape of the data should be mostly the same so that every time I rebuild the db I can expect similar queries across rebuilds to output similar data.
End result This world is built and feed with fake-messaging-app-pg. I expect to keep changing it but I can call the first iteration completed.</description></item><item><title>The Quest to learn GraphQL</title><link>//chischaschos.github.io/post/the-quest-to-learn-graphql/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2017 13:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/the-quest-to-learn-graphql/</guid><description>The Quest to learn GraphQL This is just a bunch of notes taken while learning about GraphQL.

What would you use resque or sidekiq and why?
My answer was something along the lines of:
Sidekiq consumes less memory, so that sounds better. Both Resque and Sidekiq are stable and widely used in production. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Resque in a 3 applications, two of them are still running and processing tons of background jobs. Before making my choice I would need to know the kind of background processing that we would do.</description></item><item><title>Fail inc</title><link>//chischaschos.github.io/post/fail-inc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2016 05:42:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/fail-inc/</guid><description>Fail inc</description></item><item><title>WDT's Four Phases Tests</title><link>//chischaschos.github.io/post/four-phases-test/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2016 18:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/four-phases-test/</guid><description>WDT&amp;rsquo;s Four Phases Tests A talk about Four-Phase Test for Web Dev Talks Mexico (WDT).</description></item><item><title>RSpec and the Four Phase Tests</title><link>//chischaschos.github.io/post/rspec-antipatterns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2016 20:49:58 -0600</pubDate><guid>//chischaschos.github.io/post/rspec-antipatterns/</guid><description>Motivation I want to know what are the best practices to write RSpec tests when striving for a Four Phase Test.
